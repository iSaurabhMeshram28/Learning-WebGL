# Learning WebGL

This repository documents my journey through exploring and learning WebGL. It contains code samples, experiments, and projects that I have worked on while diving into the world of WebGL.

## About

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. This repository serves as a personal learning log and a collection of resources and code to understand WebGL concepts better. 

## Technologies Used

The primary technologies used in this repository are:

- **JavaScript**: For WebGL programming and general scripting.
- **GLSL**: For writing shaders to control the graphics pipeline.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages that host the WebGL content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iSaurabhMeshram28/Learning-WebGL.git
   cd Learning-WebGL
   ```

2. Open the project files in your favorite code editor.

3. Serve the project using a local server (e.g., `http-server` or `Live Server` in VS Code) to avoid CORS issues:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by the server).
